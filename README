This is a reverse-engineered implementation of the old Macintosh Polar
game, something I saved since my college days. Right now it is just the
"back end" code for iOS, but has no GUI. I am working on a GUI as time
allows. For details see my blog:

I wrote in that blog entry "the original game had a copyright notice
(1990), and was shareware ($2.00). I can't remember if I ever sent
the author $2.00."

[He certainly deserved it, and more, for the amount of entertainment
I got out of his challenging puzzles! From what I can tell, Polar was
never popular and has largely been forgotten -- undeservedly so, in
my opinion, because it is extremely clever.]

I continued "I'm not sure how he would feel about me taking apart and
trying to re-implement his game, or whether he'd try to assert that
copyright prevented me from doing so, but I'll assume he's a nice guy
and wouldn't care as long as I don't charge for it, and go ahead, on
the theory that easier to ask forgiveness than permission."

I am not a lawyer, but I believe Mr. Endo has a valid copyright claim
to his implementation, including his original graphics and text. I do
not believe that copyright necessarily protects gameplay mechanics or
level design, but remember that part where I said I am not a lawyer?

Along with my code, I have uploaded several screen shots. These are
not intended to violate Mr. Endo's copyright. They are there for
reference.

My ultimate intent is to release this as a free game in the App Store,
with redrawn graphics, as an homage to Mr. Endo's original.
